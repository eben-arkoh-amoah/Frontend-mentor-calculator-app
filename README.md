<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This appliction  simple calculator which can be used for simple mathematical calculations. It also
allows the user to switch between three color themes . 


## About the Project

This is a  calculator application project I was assigned to build as part of my software devepment training prgram to challenge and give <br> me a hand-on practice on the theories I have learnt in javascript during the javascript phase of the training.

## How the application works
The application has two main sections.<br> The first section allows the user to switch between colour themes . It has numbers 1 , 2 and three where each one of them corresponds to a color theme. These numbers serve as the button for switching between different color themes.<br>
The second section consists of a screen which displays value(s) to a user and a keyboard with input keys where a user may compute his values.
## Tasks

- Prototype : consists well structured html styled with  css stylesheet which is user interactive<br>
with the help of javascript.
